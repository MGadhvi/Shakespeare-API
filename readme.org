* Shakespeare API
This project showcases Spring's REST API capabilities using Spring Data. The backed is a postgresql database of Shakespeare's [[https://github.com/catherinedevlin/opensourceshakespeare][plays]]

Since the data is somewhat static, the API provides access to the characters and plays but not the ability to change the underlying data
